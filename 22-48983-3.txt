Literature review

Recent research highlights increased use of AI, IoT, and data models in smart farming, targeting real-time monitoring, forecasting, and automation for better yields and efficiency.

O'Grady et al. designed a climate-smart service integrating global weather data for farming [1], improving forecasts but facing data quality and IP challenges.
Budaev et al. developed a multi-agent AI system using NDVI and soil data for real-time farm planning, improving yield and transparency [2].
Wijaya et al. applied AI for audit risk prediction, inspiring agricultural models [3], [18].
Kujawa used RBF neural networks to detect grain pests through physical features [4].
Gardezi applied ML and explainable AI to enhance farm decisions and reduce environmental harm [5].
Linaza enabled autonomous farm robots with SLAM, stereo vision, and deep learning [6].

Dhal predicted crop yields using LSTM, ARIMA, and Random Forests [7].
Mahibha used drone images and AI for early crop disease detection [8].
Ravichandran built SAgric-IoT using CNNs for greenhouse monitoring and irrigation control [9].
Arya combined sensor, drone, and satellite data with ML models to optimize farming [10].

Soil moisture studies improved with Nijaguna fusing satellite data and Bi-GRU/CNNs [11], Singh estimating moisture with ANN and Sentinel data [12], Sharma showing LSTM's superior prediction [13], and Hassan using XGBoost and SVR for soil compaction [14].

Leaf disease detection advanced via Saleem's AgriLeafNet with NASNetMobile and few-shot learning [15], Falaschetti's lightweight CNN for portable detection [16], and Gong's Faster R-CNN and YOLOv3 for apple diseases [17].

Slimani's bibliometric review highlighted AI-drone growth in agriculture [19], while Mahibha emphasized AI's role in research and tech adoption [20].

Digital platforms emerged, such as Patil's AI-powered marketplace and advisory system widely adopted by farmers [21], Chougule's AI, speech recognition, and blockchain governance platform in native languages [22], Alam's rural service delivery platform [23], and Asolo's chatbot DSS for sustainable farming advice [24].

Fatih Aslan applied AI techniques including CNNs and ensemble models to Sentinel-2 satellite data, achieving high-accuracy crop yield predictions across multiple crops (RMSE as low as 0.047-0.62 t/ha) [26].
Thi Tuan Linh Pham developed farmers' digital capabilities for e-commerce adoption in Vietnam's green tea sector, identifying four key digital skills boosting platform adoption for a B2B marketplace [27].

Altman and Zube studied public spaces using observations and interviews to inform planning. Their findings help improve live event management and community participation [28]. This can support localized farmer event sharing in rural areas.

These systems mostly address isolated tasks and often lack integration and local language support. Our proposed solution advances this by combining detection, advisory, soil analysis, and marketplace features with localized chatbot assistance, event sharing in rural areas. and real-time data fusion in a unified tool.


Provide a description of all the existing studies presented in the problem area. What are the existing software solutions (for project) available to solve the aforementioned problems?

Recent studies in smart agriculture demonstrate significant advances using AI, IoT, and data-driven models to address challenges such as real-time monitoring, crop disease detection, yield prediction, soil analysis, and farm automation. For example:

Climate-smart agriculture: O'Grady et al. developed a global weather-data-integrated forecasting system to support farm decisions, though facing data quality and intellectual property issues [1].

Multi-agent AI decision systems: Budaev et al. created a system using satellite and soil data for adaptive resource planning, increasing yield and transparency [2].

AI-based crop health and yield prediction: Studies like Ravichandran's SAgric-IoT system (using CNNs for disease detection) [9], Mahibha's drone image analysis for early disease detection [8], and Fatih Aslan's satellite-data-driven yield prediction with ensemble AI models [26] show promising results with high accuracy.

Soil moisture and quality monitoring: Multiple approaches leveraging satellite data fused with deep learning models (LSTM, Bi-GRU, XGBoost) have enhanced soil condition predictions [11,12,13,14].

Plant disease detection: Lightweight CNNs and advanced models like NASNetMobile and YOLOv3 have been applied for early, portable disease identification [15,16,17].

Digital platforms: Patil's AI-powered marketplace [21], Chougule's native language blockchain governance system [22], and Asolo's AI chatbot decision support system [24] are practical platforms empowering farmers with advisory services, market access, and localized language support.

Despite these advances, existing solutions often focus on isolated tasks-forecasting, disease detection, or market connection-and rarely integrate these functionalities into a unified tool that supports local languages, rural event sharing, and real-time data fusion.

 What are the existing software solutions available to solve the aforementioned problem? And how is your proposed solution going to extend them in providing more benefits to the users?
Existing software solutions include:

AI-based crop monitoring and disease detection systems (e.g., SAgric-IoT [9], AgriLeafNet [15]).

Climate-smart advisory platforms integrating weather data for predictive analytics (e.g., O'Grady's system [1]).

Multi-agent decision-support systems for adaptive resource planning (Budaev's AI ecosystem [2]).

Digital marketplaces and rural governance platforms enabling farmer-buyer connections and advisory in native languages (Patil [21], Chougule [22]).

Soil monitoring tools using satellite data and ML models for irrigation and crop management (Nijaguna [11], Singh [12]).

How our proposed solution extends these:
Our system is a unified, all-in-one smart farming platform that combines the strengths of these isolated systems into a seamless, user-friendly tool. It integrates:

Real-time detection and advisory: Crop disease detection powered by lightweight AI models plus AI-driven, localized chatbot advice for sustainable farming practices.

Comprehensive soil and environmental analysis: Using multi-source data fusion for precise soil moisture and quality monitoring.

Marketplace and event sharing: A bilingual farmer marketplace coupled with a community event sharing feature tailored for rural areas, encouraging social cohesion and knowledge exchange.

Localized language support: Unlike many platforms, our solution includes native language capabilities, enhancing accessibility and user adoption in rural contexts.

Real-time data fusion: Combines satellite, drone, sensor, and weather data dynamically for holistic farm management.

By bridging these features into one integrated ecosystem, our solution empowers farmers with actionable insights, enhances digital inclusivity, and drives better economic and environmental outcomes all in a single platform, because farmers shouldn't have to juggle apps like a circus performer just to grow their crops.
