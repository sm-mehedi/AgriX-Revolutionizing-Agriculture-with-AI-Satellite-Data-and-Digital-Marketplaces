  <h1>AgriX â€” Revolutionizing Agriculture with AI, Satellite Data, and Digital Marketplaces</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>AgriX</strong> is an innovative agricultural technology initiative developed at 
    <em>American International University-Bangladesh</em> during the Summer 2024-25 semester. 
    Designed with a vision to bridge the gap between technology and rural farming practices in Bangladesh, 
    AgriX integrates modern AI solutions with real-time data sources to address the challenges faced by farmers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The platform utilizes <strong>satellite imagery</strong> for soil quality and moisture analysis, 
    enabling informed decision-making for crop planning. Its AI-based <strong>crop disease detection</strong> system 
    helps farmers identify and respond to plant health issues before they escalate, reducing losses and 
    ensuring better yields. Furthermore, a <strong>bilingual chatbot</strong> (Bangla, English, and Banglish) 
    provides instant, accessible guidance tailored to the local farming community.
