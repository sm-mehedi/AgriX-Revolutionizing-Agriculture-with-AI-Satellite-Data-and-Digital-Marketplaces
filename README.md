<h2>Literature Review</h2>
Recent research in smart agriculture underscores the growing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and data modeling to support real-time monitoring, forecasting, and automation aimed at improving yield, efficiency, and sustainability.

O’Grady et al. designed a climate-smart decision-support system integrating global weather data to enhance forecasting capabilities, though their system encountered challenges with data quality and intellectual property rights [1]. Budaev et al. developed a multi-agent AI-based platform utilizing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and soil data for real-time farm resource planning, resulting in improved yield outcomes and transparency [2]. Inspired by audit risk models, Wijaya et al. demonstrated how AI-based prediction techniques could inform agricultural decision-making [3], [18]. Kujawa applied radial basis function (RBF) neural networks to detect grain pests based on physical attributes [4]. Gardezi employed machine learning and explainable AI methods to assist farmers in making environmentally sound decisions [5], while Linaza advanced autonomous farming through simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), stereo vision, and deep learning-based robotics [6].

Several studies addressed yield prediction. Dhal combined LSTM, ARIMA, and Random Forest models for forecasting crop productivity [7]. Mahibha employed drone imagery with AI for early-stage disease identification [8]. Ravichandran introduced the SAgric-IoT framework, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for greenhouse surveillance and automated irrigation [9]. Arya merged sensor, drone, and satellite data with machine learning algorithms to optimize agricultural planning [10].

Soil moisture prediction has also evolved, with Nijaguna using satellite imagery in conjunction with Bi-GRU and CNN models [11], Singh utilizing Sentinel data with artificial neural networks (ANNs) [12], Sharma highlighting LSTM’s superior performance [13], and Hassan applying XGBoost and support vector regression (SVR) for soil compaction analysis [14].

Advancements in plant disease detection have been notable. Saleem proposed AgriLeafNet, integrating NASNetMobile and few-shot learning for leaf disease recognition [15]. Falaschetti developed a lightweight CNN optimized for mobile use [16], and Gong applied YOLOv3 and Faster R-CNN to identify apple leaf diseases [17].

Trends in smart agriculture adoption have been documented. Slimani’s bibliometric review noted a surge in AI-drone integration in the field [19], and Mahibha emphasized AI’s pivotal role in both academic research and technology dissemination [20].

Digital agriculture platforms have emerged as significant enablers. Patil introduced an AI-based advisory and marketplace system, widely adopted by farmers for its practical utility [21]. Chougule’s work featured a multilingual platform combining AI, speech recognition, and blockchain-based governance [22]. Alam contributed a rural service delivery framework [23], while Asolo developed a chatbot-powered decision support system for sustainable agricultural practices [24].

Fatih Aslan applied deep learning (CNNs) and ensemble models to Sentinel-2 satellite data, achieving highly accurate yield predictions across various crops, with RMSE as low as 0.047–0.62 t/ha [26]. In the domain of rural digitization, Thi Tuan Linh Pham identified four critical digital skills that enabled Vietnamese farmers to adopt e-commerce in the green tea sector, emphasizing B2B marketplace readiness [27].

In the context of community engagement, Altman and Zube explored human interaction in public spaces through observations and interviews, yielding insights that may inform the design of rural agricultural event-sharing platforms [28].

Despite these promising developments, existing software systems often address only isolated functions—such as forecasting, disease identification, or market access—without offering a fully integrated solution. Most lack support for local languages and do not accommodate features such as rural community event sharing or real-time multi-source data fusion.

<h3>Existing Software Solutions in the Problem Area</h3>
The reviewed studies have yielded various domain-specific tools addressing key agricultural challenges:

<strong>Climate-smart systems</strong>: O’Grady’s weather-based forecasting tool [1].

<strong>AI-based resource planning</strong>: Budaev’s multi-agent farm planning system [2].

<strong>Yield and disease prediction</strong>: Mahibha [8], Ravichandran (SAgric-IoT) [9], and Fatih Aslan [26].

<strong>Soil monitoring tools</strong>: Nijaguna [11], Singh [12], Sharma [13], Hassan [14].

<strong>Disease detection solutions</strong>: Saleem’s AgriLeafNet [15], Falaschetti [16], Gong [17].

<strong>Digital platforms</strong>: Patil’s AI-powered advisory system [21], Chougule’s multilingual, blockchain-integrated platform [22], Alam’s rural delivery framework [23], and Asolo’s chatbot DSS [24].

Although these systems demonstrate technological maturity, they typically operate in silos and do not integrate critical features—such as localized AI chatbot support, cross-domain data fusion, or community event facilitation—into a cohesive platform.

<h3>Our Contribution</h3>
To address these gaps, the proposed solution—<em>AgriX</em>—offers an integrated platform combining:

AI-powered crop and poultry disease detection

Satellite-driven soil and yield analysis

A bilingual AI assistant (Bangla and English)

A digital B2B marketplace for farmers

Live rural event mapping and sharing tools

Real-time data fusion from weather, satellite, and user inputs

This unified system is designed specifically to empower smallholder farmers in regions like Bangladesh, where access to localized, comprehensive, and language-aware digital agriculture tools remains limited.
